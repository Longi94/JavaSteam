## Style

Most of the time reformatting the code in IntelliJ with default settings will suffice (CTRL + ALT + L)
 - Use 4 spaces for indenation
 - Curly brackets do not start in a new line
 - Break a statement into multiple lines if it's too long (120 char width)
 - Try to include javadoc where applicable
 - You can use the existing codebase as a style guide
